# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Sampling Techniques

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various sampling techniques and machine learning models. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, different sampling methods were applied to ensure proper training and evaluation of the models. Among all the approaches, **Sample 4 (Oversampling)** provided the best accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing class imbalance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized transaction features, along with a `Class` column indicating:
- `0`: Legitimate transaction  
- `1`: Fraudulent transaction  

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions constituting only a small percentage of the total.

## Project Steps

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset (`Creditcard_data.csv`) and analyzed its structure.
   - Checked for missing values and handled any necessary cleaning.
   - Scaled the features using techniques like MinMaxScaler (if required) to ensure compatibility with models.

### 2. **Sampling Techniques**
   To address the class imbalance, five sampling methods were applied:
   - **Sample 1**: Simple Random Sampling (SRS)  
     A random subset of the dataset was selected without focusing on class proportions.
   - **Sample 2**: Stratified Sampling  
     Ensured that both classes (`0` and `1`) were represented in the same proportion as the original dataset.
   - **Sample 3**: Systematic Sampling  
     Selected every *n-th* transaction from the dataset.
   - **Sample 4**: **Oversampling (Best Performing Sample)**  
     Increased the number of minority class (`Class=1`) instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to create a balanced dataset.  
     **Outcome**: This method achieved the highest accuracy across multiple models.
   - **Sample 5**: Undersampling  
     Reduced the majority class (`Class=0`) instances to match the size of the minority class, achieving balance by sacrificing some data.

### 3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   The following models were applied to each sample:
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree

   **Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy was used as the primary metric to compare model performance on each sample.

## Results and Key Insights

- **Sample 4 (Oversampling)** consistently provided the highest accuracy across multiple models, demonstrating its ability to handle imbalanced datasets effectively.
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed best overall when trained on the oversampled data.

| Model               | Sample 1 | Sample 2 | Sample 3 | **Sample 4 (Best)** | Sample 5 |
|---------------------|----------|----------|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Random Forest       | 0.97     | 0.95     | 0.98     | **0.98**            | Not enough class representation    |
| Logistic Regression | 0.87     | 0.83     | 0.90     | **0.98**            | Not enough class representation    |
| SVM                 | 0.68     | 0.48     | 0.66     | **0.98**            | Not enough class representation    |
| KNN                 | 0.77     | 0.73     | 0.75     | **0.98**            | Not enough class representation    |
| Decision Tree       | 0.90     | 0.87     | 0.94     | **0.98**            | Not enough class representation    |

**Key Takeaway**:  
Oversampling methods like SMOTE significantly improve model performance by balancing the dataset and ensuring sufficient representation of both classes.
